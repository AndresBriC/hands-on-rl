# Function approximation to keep the balance ðŸ’ƒ
ðŸ‘‰ [Read in datamachines]()

This is part 3 of my course Hands-on reinforcement learning.

In this part we enter new territory.

A territory where function approximation (aka supervised machine learning)
meets good old Reinforcement Learning.

### Setup

The easiest way to get the code working in your machine is by using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).


1. You can install Poetry with this one-liner:
    ```bash
    $ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
    ```

2. Git clone the code
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Paulescu/hands-on-rl.git 
    ```

3. Navigate to this lesson code `03_cart_pole`
    ```bash
    $ cd hands-on-rl/03_cart_pole
    ```

4. Install all dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ poetry install
    ```

5. and activate the virtual environment
    ```bash
    $ poetry shell
    ```

All `python` commands are executed froms this virtual environment created by poetry.

### Notebooks

1. [Explore the environment](notebooks/00_environment.ipynb)
2. [Random agent baseline](notebooks/01_random_agent_baseline.ipynb)

4. [Deep Q agent](notebooks/03_deep_q_agent.ipynb)
5. [Hyper-parameter optimization]()
6. [Homework](notebooks/04_homework.ipynb)
