# Hands-on Reinforcement Learning (RL)

> *Out of intense complexities, intense simplicities emerge*

## Welcome to my hands-on course on Reinforcement Learning ❤️

Welcome to my step by step hands-on-course that will take you from basic reinforcement learning to cutting-edge deep RL.

We will start with a short intro of what RL is, what is it used for, and how does the landscape of current
RL algorithms look like.

Then, in each following chapter we will solve a different problem, with increasing difficulty:
- 🏆 easy
- 🏆🏆 medium
- 🏆🏆🏆  hard

Ultimately, the most complex RL problems involve a mixture of reinforcement learning algorithms, optimizations and Deep Learning techniques.

You do not need to know deep learning (DL) to follow along this course.

I will give you enough context to get you familiar with DL philosophy and understand
how it becomes a crucial ingredient in modern reinforcement learning.
