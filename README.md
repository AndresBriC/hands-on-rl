# Hands-on Reinforcement Learning 

## Why this course?

Step by step hands-on-course that will take you from basic reinforcement learning to cutting-edge deep RL.

In each chapter we are going to solve a different problem, with increasing difficulty.

Ultimately, the most complex RL problems involve a mixture of reinforcement learning algorithms, optimizations and Deep Learning techniques.

You do not need to know deep learning to follow along this course.
I will give you enough context to get you familiar with DL philosophy and understand
how it becomes a crucial ingredient in modern reinforcement learning.
